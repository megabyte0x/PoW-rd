# PoW'rd

## The problem PoW'rd solves
In the current times, Freelancers face a lot of difficulties to present their previous works to clients and it's also difficult for companies to have that trust in new freelancers since they do not have proof of work. Right now freelancers just attach a few links and show that they worked on these projects but there is no proof that they were the actual ones who did that.

We are trying to solve that by helping freelancers get that Proof of Work for whatever project they worked on. The platform is simple, a freelancer comes to your platform and registers himself and when he raises an invoice and the work gets accepted he will be getting a Unique NFT that will be the proof of work for the project he worked on.

Apart from this, we are also working on a Payroll system for Companies to manage their employees easily, right now all the payments in companies are done manually on a payday, with our solution the whole thing will be automated, The employer or the company registers onto our platform and gets an ENS Subdomain for themself, once they have done it, all they need to do is add various employees onto the platform with their wallet address and set their payroll price and date. Now the contract will automatically run and send payments to the given employees on their payday from the contract wallet that has the funds.

So the next time all you need to do is make sure that your wallet balance has enough balance and the fund will be credited directly to your employee's wallet.

As mentioned earlier you can also set methods to send funds to freelancers after accepting their work.

This tool will help you in 2 things, first is managing the payrolls of your workforce and the next one is managing the freelancers that you are working with and release their payments all hassle free without any pain.

## Challenges we ran into
Navigating through SDKs in a limited timespan.
Figuring out the project architecture.
Implementation of sub-sub-domains using ENS
Due to time constraint, failed to create a notification panel, rather redirected to the portal making the end user navigate to another site.
Shifted to Quicknode due to lack of documentation on another platform which was our primary choice
Staying Awake lol
